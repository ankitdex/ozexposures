<h3 id="this-code-of-conduct-applies-across-online-forums-conferences-and-other-events-hosted-by-hasgeek">What is product photography?</h3>

<p>Product photography is a branch of commercial photography which is about accurately but attractively representing a product. The principal application of product photography is in product catalogues and brochures, with a proportion of product images also being used in advertising. The equipment used in product photography is very important and can make the difference in quality and end result.

<p>Photography is so important primarily because people generally aren’t good at describing the things they see so quality product photography would be able to replace the customers’ five senses. For online retailers, product photography for e-commerce needs to supplement the 5 senses for the item that a shopper would normally rely on to make a decision on the purchase in-person. Good photography adds authority, which in turn generates the trust of the customer. E-commerce is clearly more dependent on photography than any other kind of sales channel, because it breaks from the traditional ‘bricks and mortar shopping experience. Customers cannot simply walk into a store, pick up, sit on, sit in or even taste the product they are interested in, before making the purchase. An e-commerce website needs to convey all the same information through a variety of narrower mediums, primarily photographs, words and video.</p>

<p>Quality product images are a key driver of store engagement, conversion and retention, and overall customer lifetime value. We live in a visual world. When customers land on the store page, their attention gravitates to the images first and, if they like what they see, they keep on browsing and, hopefully, make a purchase. That is why product photography is essential for the success of any ecommerce operation. The quality of the images will define the first interaction, the perceived value of your products, and your brand’s image. First impressions can make or break an ecommerce store and the product photos are at the helm of that interaction. There are a few key decision points along the way of a successful photo shoot, and, if we keep them in check, we will consistently get images that keep our customers coming back.
</p>

<h3>Why do we do product shoot?</h3>

<p>Product photography shows that every detail in the frame communicates something to the audience, and make them feel a certain way (i.e, the light, the tonality, the point of focus, the composition, etc.) so being aware and intentional are important. Here we make the products appeal in a way that attracts our customers and that’s why the right type of product shoot is important. Creative way of product photography is an amazing opportunity to show the uniqueness of our products and will engage more with our audience.
</p>

<p>To set the products in the right scenes and places helps the potential customers imagine the product for their own use. Sometimes a photo manipulation can also help to effectively communicate what a traditional photograph cannot. So being creative is one of the key things in a product shoot and in product photography. So why do we need creative product photography? 
</p>

<p>In Today’s world we see the online marketing demands innovation in the way products are being presented. Most of them being led by the big brands and fashion houses that make their creative product photography ideas in unique images. As we live in the days of the advancement of technology people prefer to shop online as it is a quicker and easier way to shop.  We see that by 2017, people buy more from online stores than they do from stores and it keeps increasing.
</p>

<p>The importance of product photography cannot be understated at all as the online presence has become our shop with the influence of the social media growing each day.  Having an excellent imagery is important as we can easily get it out in front of people and we can effectively target our buyers. The consumer expectations are not constant at all and depending on our purpose we will need our items to be shot in a number of different ways. Some of these ways should be from simple straightforward product photography, to stylist photography demonstrating movements, to brand aligned location model shoots and so on.
</p>

<h3>Ecommerce product photography:</h3>

<p>When we are selling stuff online , pictures matter a lot and our ecommerce product photography will many times decide whether or not someone buys or not, so doing it right is very important. There are many advantages in shopping online but one thing is they don’t get the full product experience so we better nail the visuals right. Sometimes we can also ask the question how do we make the people feel when they see a product? So communicating it in the right way through the right photo shoot will help them feel and want to buy the product.
</p>

<h3>Lighting condition in product photography</h3>
<p>Lighting is one of the major important factors for a successful image. It plays an important role into our exposure and our results. When taking photos, light enhances our photographic skills. We control the light in order to get the right and best texture, vibrancy of colour and luminosity on our subjects. We see there are advantages and disadvantages in the two main lights we use and they are the studio light and natural light.  Neither and both are better because it all depends on how we control it. It is needed to observe the right lighting condition which suits us best and of course should suit the budget. The thing to remember is never to limit ourselves but rather create solutions for everything. 
</p>

<p>The perceived value of the products and trustworthiness of our band is often judged based on the quality of our visual presentation and that’s why having a good quality, beautiful product photography can go a long way. However, not every store owner can afford a professional photography studio so DIY product photography provides another alternative. As long as we have the proper tools and techniques our product shoot would be amazing within our grasp. There are hundreds of product photography tools to help us get the job done alone by our self.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
