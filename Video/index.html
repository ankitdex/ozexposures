<h3>Pre-Production</h3>
<p>This is the first and the most important step in the video production process, because without it, everything will fall apart. So we take a good amount of time to get it right. We never go to a video shoot before we have a detailed schedule and know precisely what footage to capture.
</p>

<p>Pre-production is a crucial phase of the production process and it demands careful planning and preparation so we research our client’s goals, audience, and market to develop concept and direction of the project, as well as script, storyboard, locations, schedule, and cast for the video project. We iron out all the details and ensure an easy, consistent, and cost effective shoot.</p>

<h3>Post-Production</h3>

<p>Post production is about story, style, sound and presentation. Through editing, sound design, grading and color correction we stitch together and deliver an effective final product. Editing is where the magic happens. With the latest software and talented editors, your footage is transformed into a work of art. Our post-production services include motion graphics, titles, 2D & 3D animation, voiceover, visual effects, music, sound design and colour grading.</p>



<h3>Research</h3>

<p>Research helps to take your project to the next level. It is capable of showing all the aspects of the issue to be filmed. It also unfolds some unexplored aspects of the matter concerned. By researching all the facts and figures, we are better equipped to fully understand the issue we are trying to portray on the screen and thus we are more capable of making it according what the masses are looking for, what is the demand of the client and apparently that’s what we deliver.
</p>


<ul>
  <h4>Our Approach</h4>
  <li>Choose a topic</li>
  <li>Apply best suitable method of research</li>
  <li>Collect the data</li>
  <li>Analyze the data</li>
  <li>Write it all up and draw conclusion</li>

</ul>

<h3>Editing</h3>

<p>Editing is an art form. The pace, rhythm and structure of an edit tell a story as much as the actors, locations and camera movement, so we take the time to get it right. </p>
<p>Once the footage is captured it is assigned to Video Editors specialized in working on that particular type of project. We have dedicated professionals for projects in different niches such as Ads, Films, Video clips, Drone, YouTube or Corporate video. So no matter what kind of video editing style you want, we have the right editor to do the job.</p>

<h3>Concept & Scripting</h3>
<p>Creating a concept is an extremely important component to making your  video shine. It’s also one of the most collaborative parts of the process.
</p>

<p>From our research we’re able to extract a story that will not only resonate well with your audience, but motivate and drive change. With you as our guide, our writers and artists will pen a script because a well-written, engaging script is the foundation for a successful video and without the right foundation, the rest of the creation process is in vain. 
</p>
<p>We always start concept and scripting part by having you fill out a creative brief. A brief help us understand what you do, who your customers are, and what you’re hoping to accomplish with your business video.
</p>
<p>Next we narrow down the ideas, with a list of rough concepts to choose from, we narrow down the best ones – the ones that are unique and creative, and also in line with your marketing strategy or engagement techniques. Sometimes this involves combining aspects of multiple concepts, or tweaking certain ones for selecting the best.
</p>
<p>From there, we polish things up into a pitch deck with a mock script, detailed written description, related visuals, and reference videos that help you understand our video concepts.</p>

<ul>
  <h4>Our Approach</h4>
  <li>Establish the purpose and goal of the video</li>
  <li>Understanding the mode of persuasion</li>
  <li>Setting up the script </li>
  <li>Analyzing the audience </li>
  <li>Finalizing the script</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sound Design</h3>
<p>Your audience is pretty forgiving of poor quality picture, but as soon as they hear bad audio, they won’t stick around to hear what you have to say. We make sure the audio is recorded clean in production, but we take it a step further in post by leveling and mixing sound, adding music, and giving your voiceovers that radio quality sound.</p>

<p>We provide only the best voice editing services. Our cutting edge software and hardware technology gives you the best sonic quality. Whether it is simple voice editing services or complex musical splicing, we deliver exceptional services at the most affordable cost. 
</p>

<p>We have a dedicated, deluxe, soundproof audio booth where our clients can record basic voiceover with one artist, or a fully-directed session with multiple artists, we have the means to master audio excellence with premium quality. </p>

<ul>
  <h4>Our Approach</h4>
  <li>Remove unwanted words, sentences and sections.</li>
  <li>Remove and edit unwanted fillers like umm, ahh. Remove coughs, unintentional breaks etc.</li>
  <li>Remove long pauses and silence wherever they occur in the file.</li>
  <li>Splice intro music.</li>
  <li>Making your music/loops perfectly synced to the tempo, without any jerks or glitches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Production</h3>

<p>Lights, camera, action! This is the part most people think of when we talk about video production. It’s when we get out and capture the content we’ll use in your video. Our agile team of cinematographers, directors, designers, and producers will lead the charge to make sure we get the shots, sound, and content we need to tell your story. Whether we're shooting on-location, in studio, or out in the street, our cinematographers are prepared to capture the highest quality footage for your media project. The director will oversee the production, ensuring you get the most value for your time.
</p>

<h3>Motion Graphics</h3>

<p>Sometimes acting or a simple camera movement doesn’t tell the full story. In cases like these, our talented designers and motion graphics artists will create elements that clarify and support your message that otherwise wouldn’t have the same impact. We are committed to staying at the forefront that is possible technically and creatively. 
</p>
